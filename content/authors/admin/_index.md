Chen Wang is a Ph.D candidate of affective computing at the Computer Vision and Multimedia Lab. 
Her research focuses on how to recognise human impressions automatically from non-verbal cues, such as facial expressions, gestures and physiological signals.
She is particularly interested in the use of multimodal and physiological measures for improving human-human and human-computer interactions.
