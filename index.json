In order to recognise emotions automatically, reliable emotional labels are required to learn a mapping from human expressions to corresponding emotions. Dimensional emotion models have become popular and have been widely applied for annotating emotions continuously in the time domain. However, the statistical relationship between emotional dimensions is rarely studied. This paper provides a solution to automatic emotion recognition for the Audio/Visual Emotion Challenge (AVEC) 2018. The objective is to find a robust way to detect emotions using more reliable emotion annotations in the valence and arousal dimensions.","tags":null,"title":"Towards a better gold standard: Denoising and modelling continuous emotion annotations based on feature agglomeration and outlier regularisation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chen Wang","Thierry Pun and Guilaume Chanel"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Recent research has proposed different methodologies for the unobtrusive detection of heart rate (HR) using human face recordings. These methods are based on subtle color changes or motions of the face due to cardiovascular activities, which are invisible to human eyes but can be captured by digital cameras. Several approaches have been proposed such as signal processing and machine learning. However, these methods are compared with different datasets, and there is consequently no consensus on method performance. In this article, we describe and evaluate several methods defined in literature, from 2008 until present day, for the remote detection of HR using human face recordings. The general HR processing pipeline is divided into three stages face video processing, face blood volume pulse (BVP) signal extraction, and HR computation. Approaches presented in the paper are classified and grouped according to each stage. At each stage, algorithms are analyzed and compared based on their performance using the public database MAHNOB-HCI. Results found in this article are limited on MAHNOB-HCI dataset. Results show that extracted face skin area contains more BVP information. Blind source separation and peak detection methods are more robust with head motions for estimating HR.","tags":null,"title":"A Comparative Survey of Methods for Remote Heart Rate Detection From Frontal Face Videos","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In any encounter the first moments are critical and the impressions that we form of others matter. These impressions tend to last and affect the interaction experience. The goal of this project is to build an anthropomorphic virtual character (ECA - Embodied Conversational Agent) able to make the best possible first impression on a user, thus effectively engaging him or her in an interaction. This goal will be realized by building an affective loop which ties the behavior of the ECA to the actual emotional reactions of the user facing it in real-time. This will give rise to an ECA capable of managing their first impressions on users. We focus on the identification and modeling of the nonverbal behavior, towards exhibiting, managing and maintaining impressions of two important socio-cognitive dimensions in the first minutes of interaction with a user. These dimensions are warmth (i.e. being friendly, agreeable, engaging and approachable) and competence (i.e. appear skilled, knowledgeable on a given topic). The IMPRESSIONS project has humanistic and computational components. The analysis and modeling of nonverbal communicative behavior is drawn from existing literature in sociology and psychology, as well as from new data gathered from controlled user studies. The computational component implements those models in a virtual agent, resulting in believable and effective social behaviors. Furthermore, user’s behaviors and physiological signals will help the agent managing the desired impressions. The analysis of multimodal signals is valuable to assess the user’s affective states, to determine the quality of the interaction, and, ultimately, for assessing the impressions that the user has formed of the agent. Results undergo a thorough user evaluation.\n  ","date":1524787200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1524787200,"objectID":"d1311ddf745551c9e117aa4bb7e28516","permalink":"http://chenwang.ch/project/external-project/","publishdate":"2018-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/external-project/","section":"project","summary":"In any encounter the first moments are critical and the impressions that we form of others matter.","tags":null,"title":"Managing First Impressions for a more Engaging Virtual Agent","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"  ","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"8f66d660a9a2edc2d08e68cc30f701f7","permalink":"http://chenwang.ch/project/internal-project/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/internal-project/","section":"project","summary":"The proposed methods are based on subtle colour changes on face due to cardiovascular activities.","tags":["Remote Physiological Signal"],"title":"Remote Heart Rate Detection from Frontal Face Videos","type":"project"},{"authors":["Chen Wang"],"categories":["Demo"],"content":"Create a free website with Academic using Markdown, Jupyter, or RStudio.
